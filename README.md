Self-Improving Content Intelligence Platform
(Working title — rename to taste)

REFINED CONCEPT
A company onboards to the platform, teaches it who they are and what they want to achieve. SIGNAL then deploys a multi-agent system that monitors prediction market data from Polymarket as a real-time leading indicator of what the world is about to care about. It generates campaign options, recommends distribution channels, posts content, monitors performance, and — critically — feeds all of that back into itself to get smarter over time. Every campaign makes the next one better. The system learns across all three dimensions simultaneously.
This is not a content scheduler. It's a living marketing intelligence system.
