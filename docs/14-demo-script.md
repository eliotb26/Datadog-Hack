## Minute-by-Minute Script

### Minute 0–1: The Hook

Open with a Polymarket screenshot showing a market that just spiked — something concrete and current.

> "This morning, prediction markets moved $4 million on [real trending topic]. Most companies won't know this is relevant to their content strategy until it's already trending on Twitter — three days later. We fix that."

### Minute 1–2: Onboarding in 30 Seconds

Live demo of the company onboarding:
- Type in a fictional company name, industry, and goal
- Show the brand profile being created by Agent 1
- Keep it fast — this should feel effortless

### Minute 2–3: Trend Signal in Action

Pull up the live Polymarket API feed:
- Show the trend agent surfacing the top signal
- Show the relevance score explaining why it matters for this company specifically
- This is your technical credibility moment — be specific with numbers

> "At 9 AM this morning, Polymarket showed the 'Fed rate cut in March' market spiking from 34% to 61% in 48 hours on $2.1M volume. Our system flagged this as a high-confidence content opportunity for our fintech client."

### Minute 3–4: Campaign Generation

Show three campaign concepts being generated:
- Read one headline out loud — it should sound good
- Point out the Gemini-generated visual
- Point out the Modulate-informed voice-match badge (high alignment score)
- Point out the channel recommendation with reasoning

This is where the audience leans in.

### Minute 4–5: Channel Routing + Analytics Dashboard

Show the distribution routing recommendation, then flip to analytics:
- Lightdash dashboard with performance history
- Agent learning curves (the line should go up)
- Polymarket calibration graph
- This makes the self-improvement real and visual

### Minute 5–6: The Three Loops Explained

One slide, one minute. Draw or show the three feedback loops:

1. **Loop 1**: Campaign performance feeds back to improve content generation
2. **Loop 2**: Cross-company patterns make all agents smarter
3. **Loop 3**: System learns which market signals actually predict engagement

> "These three loops together are what make this genuinely self-improving — not just a tool, but a compounding system."

### Minute 6–7: Sponsor Callouts + Prize Pitch

Explicitly name every sponsor and their role:

> "We built this on **Google DeepMind's ADK** for multi-agent orchestration with **Gemini** as our reasoning and media-generation backbone. **Braintrust** powers our evaluation loops and auto-improves our prompts. **Airia** orchestrates the entire pipeline with A/B testing via Battleground. **Cleric's** memory architecture inspired our three-tier learning system. **Modulate Velma-2** turns spoken brand briefs into transcript + voice signals that we convert into a measurable voice profile so every campaign matches how the brand actually sounds. **Lightdash** turns our feedback loops into business-readable intelligence. And **Datadog** gives us full observability into every agent call, every API response, and every feedback cycle."

## Demo Tips

- **Pre-seed data**: Have 2-3 companies already onboarded with campaign history
- **Real signals**: Use actual Polymarket data from the morning of the demo
- **Backup video**: Record a full demo run the night before in case of live failures
- **Tab order**: Have all browser tabs pre-opened in the right order
- **Font size**: Increase terminal and browser font size for projector visibility
